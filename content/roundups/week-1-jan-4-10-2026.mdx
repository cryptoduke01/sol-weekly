# Solana Weekly Roundup: January 4-10, 2026

Morgan Stanley just filed for a Solana ETF. Wyoming launched a state-backed stablecoin. Solana stablecoins added $900M in 24 hours.

This wasn't a quiet week.

While most chains saw ETF outflows, Solana pulled $13.7M in. The network hit $15B in stablecoin market cap and grabbed 51% of all DEX volume across crypto. Firedancer went live on mainnet, dropping finality to 150ms.

Here's what actually happened.

## The Big Money Moves

Morgan Stanley filed S-1 forms for spot Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. A major bank pushing regulated crypto products means institutional appetite is real.

Solana ETFs saw net inflows of $13.7M on January 9 alone. Bitcoin and Ethereum? Outflows.

Wyoming became the first U.S. state to launch its own stablecoin. $FRNT runs on Solana, with profits funding schools. Real-world utility, not just speculation.

JPMorgan expanded tokenization efforts on Ethereum but keeps mentioning Solana's speed advantage for financial applications. The speed debate continues.

Solana's RWA ecosystem hit $873M TVL. [State Street](https://twitter.com/StateStreet) launched a tokenized liquidity fund using PYUSD. [Ondo Finance](https://twitter.com/OndoFinance) plans tokenized US stocks and ETFs for early 2026.

---

## Stablecoins Are Eating Everything

Solana stablecoins added $900M in market cap over 24 hours (Jan 7-8). Total stablecoin supply on Solana: $15B.

The network now handles 51% of all DEX activity across crypto. $4.4B traded in a single day. Stablecoins represent 91% of Solana's on-chain capital, led by USDC, Tether, and Paxos.

[Jupiter Exchange](https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange) launched JupUSD with [Ethena Labs](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs). It's a reserve-backed stablecoin using USDtb and USDC, integrated into Jupiter Lend for on-chain settlement.

[Jito](https://twitter.com/jito_sol) launched the IBRL Explorer, a validator scoring system for performance and block-building analytics. Not everyone agrees though. Harmonic argues it pushes MEV monopoly over real execution quality.

Other DeFi moves: [Raydium](https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol) Perps went live. [Kamino Finance](https://twitter.com/KaminoFinance) Swap hit top 5 for weekly volume. Remora Markets (by [Step Finance](https://twitter.com/stepfinance_)) crossed $50M in rStocks spot volume. [Polymarket](https://twitter.com/Polymarket) partnered with [Parcl](https://twitter.com/Parcl) for real estate prediction markets. [Huma Finance](https://twitter.com/HumaFinance) launched a Prime Vault with 28% real yield from PST leverage. Perena's USD* market live on RateX DEX with [OnRe](https://twitter.com/OnRe_io) (first RWA integration).

## New Tokens Dropping

[Solana Mobile](https://twitter.com/solanamobile) confirmed $SKR token TGE on January 21. 10B supply, 20-30% airdropped to Seeker phone owners, active dApp users, and developers. Season 2 started with exclusive rewards.

Ranger ICO by [MetaDAO](https://twitter.com/MetaDAOproject) raised $3-4M+ for its derivatives exchange. Ends soon.

January launches to watch: Brevis (Jan 6) - ZK infrastructure. Fogo (Jan 13) - SVM L1. [Infinex](https://twitter.com/infinex_io) (mid-late Jan) - Trading app. [Zama](https://twitter.com/zama_fhe) (auction Jan 12-15, TGE Jan 20) - Privacy infrastructure. Warden Protocol (Jan 22) - Intents chain. MegaETH (Jan TBD) - ETH L2. HeyElsa (early Jan) - AI agents. [Sentient](https://twitter.com/sentient_ai) (premarket live) - AI protocol.

Bulk testnet launching this month too.

## Infrastructure Getting Serious

Firedancer validator client is officially live on mainnet. Finality dropped to ~150ms. The "beta network" criticism is officially dead.

[Inco Network](https://twitter.com/inconetwork) launched Lightning beta on Solana Devnet for on-chain confidentiality.

[StreamingFast](https://twitter.com/streamingfastio) shipped Solana IDL and account changes support, reduced latency, onboarded DePIN projects.

[Arcium](https://twitter.com/ArciumHQ) released Cerberus (confidential compute) and Arcis (Rust compiler) for privacy-focused developers.

[Magic Eden](https://twitter.com/MagicEden) Season 4 went live. [Solana Name Service](https://twitter.com/bonfida) added AI domain search. [Backpack](https://twitter.com/Backpack) teased Season 4 end with {REDACTED}.

Privacy audit results: Mixing protocols and shielded transfers exist but lack interoperability. ~11.4% of transactions are private. Tools like Mixoor (public beta for private SOL transfers) and GSM (on-chain MVNO for privacy eSIM) are filling gaps.

---

## Community Moves

Solana Accelerate APAC set for February 11 at Consensus Hong Kong. Focus on builders and policy.

Privacy Hack program starts January 12 for private payments and tools.

[Pump.fun](https://twitter.com/pumpdotfun) hit record weekly volume. $130B+ in 2025, $1.2B on PumpSwap. 1M+ app downloads, $500M+ revenue.

Memecoin frenzy continues with $WHITEPEPE, $PAT, $TRUMPDOGE getting attention. Community coins like $VALENTINE and $INDY gaining traction.

x402 ecosystem tools: $READ (publishing), $GAIN (AI copilot), $LUMEN (privacy), $OOBE (AI agents SDK).

[Dawn Internet](https://twitter.com/DawnInternet) Q1 roadmap: Public dashboards, Black Box release, 5.9M household coverage.

Ownership coins: $MIXOOR (privacy), $GSM (eSIM), $CPT (power tech), $KLED (data marketplace V2).

---

## The Numbers

Solana price pushed past $140 on tokenization, stablecoin growth, and ETF demand.

Solana dominates tokenized stocks: $808M vs Ethereum's $752M.

Whale accumulation despite price dips. Altcoins like Solana led $47B in crypto fund inflows for 2025.

The Vitalik vs Yakovenko debate continues: sovereignty vs speed. Two different visions for blockchain's future.

2026 predictions floating around: AI integration, RWA scaling past $1B, DeFi reboot with real interoperability.

---

## What's Next

Week 1 set the tone. Institutions are filing. Stablecoins are flowing. Infrastructure is shipping.

Solana isn't slowing down.

Stay tuned for Week 2.
