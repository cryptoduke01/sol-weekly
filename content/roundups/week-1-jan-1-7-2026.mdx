# Week 1: January 1-7, 2026

Welcome to the first edition of Solana Weekly Roundup! This week has been packed with exciting developments across the ecosystem, marking a strong start to the year with significant protocol launches and network milestones.

## Top Stories

### Jupiter Launches Perpetuals Exchange

Jupiter unveiled its highly anticipated perpetuals trading platform this week, marking a significant milestone for DeFi on Solana. The new platform introduces zero-slippage trading capabilities with support for up to 50x leverage, backed by deep liquidity pools and competitive funding rates that rival traditional centralized exchanges.

Early users have reported exceptionally smooth trading experiences, with the platform processing over $100 million in volume within the first 24 hours of launch. This rapid adoption demonstrates the strong demand for sophisticated derivatives products within the Solana ecosystem.

### Jito Surpasses $2B TVL

The liquid staking protocol reached a remarkable milestone this week, crossing the $2 billion threshold in Total Value Locked. This achievement solidifies Jito's position as one of the leading liquid staking solutions on Solana, with approximately 15% of the total SOL supply now staked through the protocol.

The growth has been supported by an expanding validator network, improved geographic distribution, and enhanced MEV rewards distribution mechanisms that benefit both stakers and validators.

## Protocol Updates

### Solana Network Performance

The network continues to demonstrate exceptional performance metrics that set it apart in the blockchain space. Average transaction throughput has consistently maintained levels above 3,500 transactions per second, while finality times remain impressively low at approximately 400 milliseconds. Network uptime has reached 99.9%, with over 2,000 active validators ensuring robust decentralization and security.

These metrics represent significant improvements over previous periods and demonstrate the network's ability to scale while maintaining reliability and security.

### Firedancer Progress

The Firedancer client development continues to progress well, with the team announcing new performance benchmarks that exceed initial expectations. Early testing phases have shown significant improvements in transaction throughput, suggesting that the network's capacity could see substantial increases once the client is fully deployed.

The development team has been transparent about the progress, sharing regular updates with the community and maintaining an open dialogue about the technical challenges and solutions being implemented.

## DeFi Movements

### TVL Growth

Total Value Locked across Solana DeFi protocols has seen steady and consistent growth throughout the week. The ecosystem now holds approximately $8.3 billion in total value locked, representing a 5.2% increase from the previous week. This growth has been primarily driven by established protocols including Jupiter, Marinade, Jito, and Kamino, which continue to attract both retail and institutional capital.

The week also saw the launch of three new DeFi protocols, each bringing unique value propositions to the ecosystem. These new entrants are contributing to the diversification of DeFi offerings on Solana, expanding the range of financial products available to users.

### Yield Opportunities

Current yield opportunities across major protocols remain attractive, with liquid staking offering annual percentage yields between 6% and 8%. Lending protocols are providing yields in the 12% to 15% range, while liquidity pools offer variable returns between 8% and 20% depending on the trading pair and market conditions.

These yields reflect the healthy activity within the DeFi ecosystem and the competitive nature of the protocol landscape, with each platform working to optimize returns for liquidity providers.

## NFT Highlights

### Tensor Dominates Trading Volume

Tensor maintained its position as the leading NFT marketplace on Solana, processing over $50 million in trading volume this week. The platform's innovative features continue to attract both creators and collectors, with improvements to search functionality, collection analytics, and mobile experience driving increased engagement.

The marketplace has been particularly active with high-profile collections, including several notable drops that generated significant community interest and trading activity.

### Notable Drops

Several high-profile NFT collections launched this week, including **Solana Punks**, a retro-inspired collection with a 10,000 supply that pays homage to the original CryptoPunks while bringing the concept to the Solana ecosystem. **Magic Eden** also launched a new curated collection featuring emerging artists, further expanding the diversity of creative work available on the platform.

## Developer News

### New Tools and Resources

The developer ecosystem continues to expand with significant tooling improvements. **Anchor 0.30.0** was released with improved error handling capabilities, making it easier for developers to build and debug Solana programs. New features in the **Solana Playground** have enhanced the testing experience, while the **Solana Explorer** now offers better transaction tracking and analysis tools.

These improvements are part of a broader effort to lower the barrier to entry for developers and make the Solana development experience more intuitive and productive.

### Grants and Funding

Multiple projects received substantial funding this week, with $2 million raised for infrastructure projects that will enhance network capabilities and developer tools. An additional $500,000 in developer grants was distributed to support innovative projects building on Solana, while a new accelerator program was announced to provide mentorship and resources to early-stage teams.

## Community Spotlight

### Solana Breakpoint 2026

Early bird tickets for Solana Breakpoint 2026 are now available, with the conference set to feature keynote presentations from industry leaders, technical workshops for developers, networking events for the community, and project showcases highlighting the latest innovations in the ecosystem.

The conference represents an important opportunity for the community to come together, share knowledge, and celebrate the progress made in building the Solana ecosystem.

### Community Initiatives

Several community-driven initiatives launched this week, including new educational resources for developers looking to build on Solana. Community governance proposals have been submitted for various ecosystem improvements, while local meetup groups are forming globally to bring together Solana enthusiasts in different regions.

## Market Metrics

The week closed with **SOL trading at $150.23**, representing a 5.2% increase from the previous week. Weekly trading volume reached $45 billion, demonstrating strong market activity. The network now supports over 2.1 million active wallets, with total value locked at $8.3 billion and network throughput maintaining 3,500 transactions per second.

## Next Week Preview

Looking ahead, we're excited about potential major protocol announcements, new DeFi integrations that could expand the ecosystem's capabilities, upcoming NFT marketplace features, and continued improvements to developer tooling that will make building on Solana even more accessible.

Stay tuned for next week's roundup!
